class AlloyAnalysis(MongoFrame):
    '''
    a substitutional alloy space contains structures with the same sites or
    structures related by either a single vacancy or intersticial defect. a
    structure prototype is used to expand an alloy space for a material family.
    similar structures to the prototype and its defect structures (exemplars)
    are found using a distance metric of structural feature vectors, which are
    stored in a local database of structures. the neighborhoods of compounds
    that are similar to the exemplars can be analyzed using heirarchical
    principle component analysis, which visualizes the maximum variance in and
    among the neighborhoods of structures.

    local structure database must contain "material_id", "structure", and
    "structure_features" fields. MPStructureSpace constructs a compatible
    database for this workspace, but could be extended to the OQMD structures

    Attributes:

        alloy attributes
        . parent (Structure) pymatgen object that alloy space is built around
        . exemplars (DataFrame) contains both pymatgen Structures and their
            feature vectors. an exemplar (row of DataFrame) is a structure that
            is either the parent structure or a vacancy/intersticial structure.
            the first row is the exemplar of the parent structure
        . distances (DataFrame) pairwise distances matrix of the database
            structures (row) and exemplars (column)
        . neighborhoods ([DataFrame]) the index contains the unique database
            entry identifier, the data contains the feature vectors of
            each structure in the neighborhood of each exemplar (list order is
            preserved from row order of exemplars attribute)

        inherited from MongoFrame:
        . path (str) path to local mongodb
        . database (str) name of the database
        . collection (str) name of the collection
        . connection (Collection|None) statefull pymongo connection to storage
        . dataframe (DataFrame|None) temporary data storage

    TODO:
    . what is the best set of structural feature vectors for matching?
    . what is the best distance metric for finding similar structures?
